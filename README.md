# Custom Auth

The OAuth2 for Firebase Spark.

## How to Create My Own Custom Auth

To create your Custom Auth, follow these steps:

1. Create the following files:
    - `auth.html`
    - `apps.html`
    - `login.html`
    - `register.html`
    - `firebase-config.js`

2. Ensure your Firebase Project is added to use credentials.
3. After completing the setup for Firebase Auth, check that your HTML files and modules are imported correctly.
4. After completing the setup for Firebase Realtime Database, place your project credentials in `firebase-config.js`. If you don't see the credentials, go to Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts > Firebase Admin SDK.
5. Have fun with the code!

Make sure to configure and link these files properly to ensure a seamless authentication experience.
